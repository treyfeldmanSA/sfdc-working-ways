    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">By reading this proposal, you hereby agree to the following completely non-binding terms.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By scrolling past the hero section, clicking any accordion, or making eye contact with a meeting modal, you acknowledge that change is inevitable and two-week sprints might actually be better.</p>
    
    <h2>2. The "Better Way" Guarantee</h2>
    <p>We guarantee this process will reduce firefighting, increase shipping velocity, and give you your weekends back – or your sanity refunded. (Refunds issued in the form of retroactive high-fives and reduced Slack anxiety.)</p>
    
    <h2>3. Meeting Attendance Policy</h2>
    <p>All sprint ceremonies will be kept efficient and time-boxed. If standups exceed 15 minutes, coffee is on management. Skipping meetings may result in increased blockers and "I had no idea" moments.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Definition of Ready Compliance</h2>
    <p>Half-baked stories are not permitted in sprints. Violators will be gently redirected to backlog refinement. Repeat offenders get assigned to write acceptance criteria for everyone else.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Humor & Easter Eggs Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>All jokes, popups, and witty FAQ answers are for entertainment purposes only. If not amused, please provide feedback. We'll workshop better material in the next retro.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Experimentation Clause</h2>
    <p>This is an experiment for Sprints 16 & 17. If it doesn't work, we pivot. If it does work, we keep going. That's how experiments work.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>These terms may be updated during sprint retrospectives based on team feedback. We'll notify you via the same communication channels we use for everything else (probably Slack).</p>
    
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall the proposal author be liable for any productivity lost while reading this document, scrolling for coupons, or clicking meeting boxes to see what they do. (But honestly, this is more productive than most meetings.)</p>
    
    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All popup offers, fake discounts, and "achievement unlocked" messages remain the property of this proposal. Feel free to steal them for your own presentations – imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.</p>
    
    <div class="disclaimer">
        <p><strong>Fine Print:</strong> This is not actual legal advice. It's a proposal for better teamwork masquerading as legalese. No lawyers were consulted – or harmed – in the making of this page.</p>
